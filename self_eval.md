# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
  - Wow, methods are wild. There's so many of them! How often do you try to define your own method and realize it's already used? I think I need to keep trying different methods but I don't know when each one _actually_ applies.


- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
  - Simple methods, okay. But again, it's going to get so complicated!


- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
 - I saw wording in example defined methods like "larger" and "smaller" ... is that wording really what it needs? It feels like ruby is _too smart_ if that's all it needs to know you want the method to compare the two values.
 - What is the benefit of nil? So far it gives responses that look like errors so it's stressful for me. I keep thinking the code is broken?
